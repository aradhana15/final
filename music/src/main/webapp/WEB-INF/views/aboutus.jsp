A musical instrument is an instrument created or adapted to
	make musical sounds. In principle, any object that produces sound can
	be a musical instrumentâ€”it is through purpose that the object becomes a
	musical instrument. The history of musical instruments dates to the
	beginnings of human culture. Early musical instruments may have been
	used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a
	drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition
	and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments
	evolved in step with changing applications. The date and origin of the
	first device considered a musical instrument is disputed. The oldest
	object that some scholars refer to as a musical instrument, a simple
	flute, dates back as far as 67,000 years.
	 Some consensus dates early
	flutes to about 37,000 years ago. However, most historians believe that
	determining a specific time of musical instrument invention is
	impossible due to the subjectivity of the definition and the relative
	instability of materials used to make them. Many early musical
	instruments were made from animal skins, bone, wood, and other
	non-durable materials.</p>
